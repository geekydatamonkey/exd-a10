## Doing:
  - ForceTree a tree that has forces like repulsion, to allow for some natural movement and keep DOM nodes from overlapping.
    * new Tree()
    * addNode() - creates a new node
    * connect(node1, node2)
    * update() - update positioning of nodes of the tree given forces
    * render() - renders a tree
